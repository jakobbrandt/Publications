Data analysis carried out in this markdown file relates to the article *Investigation of Detection Limits and the Influence of DNA Extraction and Primer Choice on the Observed Microbial Communities in Drinking Water Samples using 16S rRNA Gene Amplicon Sequencing*.
This study investigated the impact of DNA extraction method and primer choice on the observed microbial community as well as estimating a lower detection limit from 16s rRNA amlicon gene sequencing. The significance of extraction method was investigated by comparing the two commercial DNA extraction kits FastDNA SPIN Kit for Soil and PowerWater DNA Isolation Kit (renamed to DNeasy PowerWater Kit). Impact of primer choice on the observed microbial community was illustrated by using three different primer sets targeting the V13, V34 and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Estimations of the detection limit were based on bacteria-free water samples (1 L) spiked with *Escherichia coli* cells in different concentrations [10^1 â€“ 10^6 cells/ml].
